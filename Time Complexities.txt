- Mini Max Sum:

Initializing variables = constant time O(c)

First for loop goes from i=1 until 4 = constant time O(4) 

Second for loop goes from i=0 until 4 = constant time O(4)

This code has a constant time complexity.

- Hackerrank in a String!:

Initializing variables = constant time O(c)

For loop of current goes from i=0 until 9, while int i goes from i=0 to the length of the string = linear time O(n) where n is the length of the string

Increasing current++ is constant work

This code has linear time complexity.
